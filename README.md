# To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma
> In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Created train & validation dataset from the train directory with a batch size of 32 .
- Resized images to 180*180.(10%)
- Created a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset.
- Trained the model for ~20 epochs.
- Explained the findings after the model fit with evidence if the model overfits or underfits.


## Conclusions
- the conclusion is provided at the end of each model execution in the python notebook
